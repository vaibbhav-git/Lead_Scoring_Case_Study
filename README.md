# Lead Scoring Case Study

### Project Description:
	An education company named X Education needs help to select the most promising leads, i.e. the leads that are most likely to convert into paying customers. The company requires us to build a model wherein you need to assign a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers with higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with lower lead score have a lower conversion chance. The CEO, in particular, has given a ballpark of the target lead conversion rate to be around 80%.

### Goals and Objectives:
	Build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads. A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert whereas a lower score would mean that the lead is cold and will mostly not get converted.

### Research Flow:
	Data Cleaning and Data Manipulation.
	Exploratory Data Analysis.
	Dummy variable creation, binary variable encoding, and feature scaling.
	Building a logistic regression model and evaluation of the model.
	Building ROC curve.
